## Instructions for programmers

Install the Arduino IDE on your machine
Configure it to accept ESP8266
Download and unzip the OneWire library into the Arduino libraries folder on your machine
Download and unzip the DallasTemperature library into the Arduino libraries folder on your machine
Download the repository [ ] openlab folder from queenslab github website
Analyze the code in the Temperature.ino arduino file. Change your SSID to match a desired unique name
Analyze the contents of the html code in the data folder.
Connect your device to your computer through a mini usb device provided to you.
Upload the Temperature.ino sketch to the device.
Now on either the same computer or a different device i.e. mobile phone, connect to your network with a chosen SSID in 6 above.
In any chosen web browser, navigate to IP address 192.168.1.1 and see the default display of the html code you analyzed in 5 above. 
Contemplate on how you can improve the display using any thought of means.

## Instructions for designers

Think of the interface to display the sensor data and how it could be appealing to the end user.
Think of how the device could be best packaged to create a near-to-purchase/off-shelf product
