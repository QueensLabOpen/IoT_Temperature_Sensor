## Instructions for respective groups to follow

###### Programmers [15-20 minutes setup]
**NB: _Call for help is your group realises that its taking more time than estimated_**

* Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on your machine. Alternatively an online [IDE](https://create.arduino.cc/) can be used for this task.
* Configure the Arduino IDE to work with the ESP8266. Follow the instructions in [this](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)  link
* Download and unzip the [OneWire](OneWire.zip) library into the Arduino libraries folder on your machine
* Download and unzip the [DallasTemperature](DallasTemperature.zip) library into the Arduino libraries folder on your machine
* Analyze the code in the [Temperature.ino](Temperature.ino) arduino file. Change your SSID to match a desired unique name
* Analyze the contents of the html code in the data folder. Ensure that the data folder, Header.h and Temperature.ino all lie in the same folder.
* Connect your device to your computer through a mini usb device provided to you.
* Upload the Temperature.ino sketch to the device.
* Now on either the same computer or a different device i.e. mobile phone, connect to your network with a chosen SSID in 6 above.
* In any chosen web browser, navigate to IP address 192.168.1.1 and see the default display of the html code you analyzed in 5 above. 
Contemplate on how you can improve the display using any thought of means.

###### Designers

* Think of the interface to display the sensor data and how it could be appealing to the end user.
* Think of how the device could be best packaged to create a near-to-purchase/off-shelf product
